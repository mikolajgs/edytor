Yet another graphic editor in pure Javascript.

This is an old hobby project that has been started ages ago and it's developed at a leisurely pace.  Hence, there are
no sensible deadlines.  It's meant to be tagged with v1 somewhere in 2024.

Version 1.0 is meant to have basic graphic tools such as pencil, line, shapes, fill, text, selection etc.
